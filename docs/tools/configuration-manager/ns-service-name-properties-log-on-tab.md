# NS$&lt;service name&gt; Properties (Log On Tab)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]
  Use the **Log On** tab of the **Notification Services Properties** dialog box to specify the account used by the [!INCLUDE[ssNS](../../includes/ssns-md.md)] service, and to start and stop the service.

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] recommends using a domain user account with minimal rights for services. For information about selecting an account, search Books Online for the topic, "Setting Up Windows Service Accounts."
