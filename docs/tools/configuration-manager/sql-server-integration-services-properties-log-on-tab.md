[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Windows Only](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-windows-only.md)]
  Use the **Log On** tab of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] **Properties** dialog box to specify the account used by the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service, and to start and stop the service.

For information about selecting an account, search Books Online for the topic, "Setting Up Windows Service Accounts."
