# Ordered and Unordered Expressions (XQuery)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database ](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  By default, the ordering mode for all operations in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is **ordered**. Therefore, the node sequences returned by the path expressions and the FLWOR expressions, without the **order by** clause, are in document order.  
  
 The additional **ordered** and **unordered** syntax described in the XQuery specification is not supported.
