# Filter and Sort Dialog Box

In SQL Server Object Explorer, you can right click a table or view and select **View Data** (for more information see [How to: View and Edit Data in a Table](../ssdt/how-to-view-and-edit-data-in-a-table.md)). Beginning in the March 2014 release of SQL Server Data Tools, the **Data Editor** has a Sort and filter button in the toolbar. You can modify the data that is displayed in a table or view.  
  
In the **Filter and Sort** dialog box, you can specify which data will be displayed in the **Data Editor**:  
  
-   Number of rows displayed.  
  
-   Which columns to display.  
  
-   Aliases for column names.  
  
-   Constraints to display columns.  
  
-   Sort order of columns.  
  
You can also right click on a row and in the **Filter and Sort** dialog box and select an operation to perform on a row.
