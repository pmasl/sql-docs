# Change the Default Location for Projects
[!INCLUDE[SQL Server Azure SQL Database Synapse Analytics PDW](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi-asa-pdw.md)]
The default location for files and projects is the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Projects folder in your My Documents folder.  
  
### To change the default location for projects  
  
1.  Change the default location by opening or saving a file or project from another location. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] SQL Server Management Studio stores the location of the previously opened project and uses it for the next opening or saving of a project.
