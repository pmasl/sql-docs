# Add Derived Tables to Queries (Visual Database Tools)

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
Derived tables are result sets used as table sources in a query. You can add a derived table to a query in the **Diagram Pane**.  
  
### To add a derived table to a query  
  
1.  Open an existing query or create a new query.  
  
2.  Right-click the **Diagram Pane** and choose **Add New Derived Table**.  
  
    A new table with the name derivedtbl_*N* is added, and the derived table's SELECT statement is added to the query's FROM clause.
