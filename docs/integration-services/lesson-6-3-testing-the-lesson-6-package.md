# Lesson 6-3: Test the Lesson 6 package

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


At run time, your package gets the value for the **Directory** property from the **VarFolderName** parameter.  
  
To verify that the package updates the **Directory** property, execute the package. Because you copied three sample data files to the new directory, the data flow runs three times.
  
## Check the package layout  
Before you test the package, verify that the control and data flows in the Lesson 6 package are similar to the objects shown in the following diagrams:   
  
**Control Flow**  
  
![Control Flow](../integration-services/media/task4lesson2control.gif "Control Flow")  
  
**Data Flow**  
  
![Data Flow](../integration-services/media/task5lesson5data.gif "Data Flow")  
  
## Test the Lesson 6 package  
  
1.  On the **Debug** menu, select **Start Debugging**.  
  
2.  After the package has completed running, on the **Debug** menu, select **Stop Debugging**.  
  
## Go to next task
