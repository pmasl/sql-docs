# Azure Resource Manager Connection Manager

[!INCLUDE[sqlserver-ssis](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver-ssis.md)]


The **Azure Resource Manager Connection Manager** enables an SSIS package to manage Azure resources using a [service principal](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).

The **Azure Resource Manager Connection Manager** is a component of the [SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) Feature Pack for Azure](../../integration-services/azure-feature-pack-for-integration-services-ssis.md).

To create and configure an **Azure Resource Manager Connection Manager**, follow the steps below:

1. In the **Add SSIS Connection Manager** dialog box, select **AzureResourceManager**, and click **Add**.
2. In the **Azure Resource Manager Connection Manager Editor** dialog box, specify the **Application ID**, **Application Key**, and **Tenant ID** for the service principal. For details about these properties, please refer to [this](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal) article.
3. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
4. You can see the properties of the connection manager you created in the **Properties** window.
