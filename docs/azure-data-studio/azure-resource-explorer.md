# Explore and manage Azure SQL resources with Azure Resource Explorer

In this document, you learn how you can explore and manage Azure SQL Server, Azure SQL database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance resources through Azure Resource Explorer in [!INCLUDE [Azure Data Studio](../includes/name-sos-short.md)].

>[!NOTE]
>The Azure Resource Explorer is supported in SQL Server 2019. After that, you can install the extension through [extension manager](./extensions/add-extensions.md) or through **File** > **Install Package from VSIX Package**.

## Connect to Azure

After installing the SQL plugin, an Azure icon appears in the left menu bar. Click the icon to open Azure Resource Explorer. If you don't see the Azure icon, right click the left menu bar, and select **Azure Resource Explorer**.

### Add an Azure account

To view the SQL resources associated with an Azure account, you must first add the account to [!INCLUDE [Azure Data Studio](../includes/name-sos-short.md)].

1. Open **Linked Accounts** dialog through the account management icon on the left bottom, or through **Sign in to Azure...** link in Azure Resource Explorer.
