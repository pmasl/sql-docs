  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)], you can create a test user and log into the web application to test permissions.When a user attempts to access the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../includes/ssmdsmdm-md.md)] URL, the user's credentials are authenticated. In Internet Explorer, security settings control whether this occurs automatically or if the user must enter a user name and password. To change these settings, complete the following steps:  
  
### To test a user's security  
  
1.  In Internet Explorer 7 and later, click **Tools**, **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.  
  
2.  Click **Local Intranet** and then the **Custom Level** button.  
  
3.  In the **User Authentication** section, choose **Prompt for user name and password**.  
  
4.  The next time you open the browser window, you will be prompted for a user name and password.
