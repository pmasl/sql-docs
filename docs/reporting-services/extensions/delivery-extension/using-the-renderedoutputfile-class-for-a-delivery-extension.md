# Using the RenderedOutputFile Class for a Delivery Extension
  The <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> class represents a data stream and information about the data stream's associated properties. The **Data** property of the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> class is used to represent a rendered report or report resource as a **Stream** object.  
  
 The <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.Report.Render%2A> method of the **Report** object returns an array of one or more <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> objects that together constitute a single rendered report. The first <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> object is the rendered report. Any other <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> objects are resources that must be delivered along with the report data (for example, an HTML file and associated images). Rendering extensions that are single-stream rendering extensions (IMAGE, PDF, MHTML, and EXCEL) return only one <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> object in the array.  
  
 For an example of how to use the <xref:Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.RenderedOutputFile> class, see [SQL Server Reporting Services Product Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=177889).
