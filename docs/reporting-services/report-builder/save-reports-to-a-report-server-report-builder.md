# Save Reports to a Report Server (Report Builder)
  In Report Builder, you can save a report definition to a report server (also known as publishing a report). When the report is saved to a report server, other users can view the report. Each time you run the published report, you will retrieve the most current data. To save a static copy of a rendered report, export the report to a different file format and save it or use the report history feature to save versions of rendered reports.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The location of the saved report definition does not affect whether the report is processed on the server or processed locally when you preview the report.  
  
### To save a report to a report server  
  
1.  From the Report Builder button, click **Save**. The **Save As**_\<Report Item>_ dialog box opens.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you are resaving a report, it is automatically resaved to its previous location. Use the Save As option to change location.  
  
2.  Optionally, click **Recent Sites and Servers** to show a list of recently used report servers and SharePoint sites.  
  
3.  Browse to the report server location where you want to save the report.  
  
4.  In **Name**, type the name of the report.
