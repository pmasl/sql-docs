 This is a general purpose error that occurs when either the report server or a report authoring tool has invalid configuration settings. The error is usually accompanied by a second message that states the actual cause of the error.  
  
 The following list summarizes possible causes:  
  
-   The RSReportServer.config or RSReportDesigner.config file cannot be found or read.  
  
-   XML elements in either configuration file are missing or invalid.  
  
-   Values for one or more XML elements are missing or invalid.  
  
-   Registry settings are invalid.
