# Extended Static Geography Methods
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb-asdbmi.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports several extensions to the static geography methods of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).
