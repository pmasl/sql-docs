# String Operators (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Managed Instance](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]


[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides the following string operators. String concatenation operators can combine two or more of the following data types into one expression: 
* character or binary strings
* columns 
* combination of strings and column names 

Wildcard string operators can match one or more characters in a string comparison operation. LIKE and PATINDEX are examples of two of these operations.
