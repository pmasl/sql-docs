> The **SqlServer** module is the current PowerShell module to use.
>
> The **SQLPS** module is included with the SQL Server installation (for backward compatibility) but is no longer updated.
>
> The **SqlServer** module contains updated versions of the cmdlets in **SQLPS** and includes new cmdlets to support the latest SQL features.
>
> Install the **SqlServer** module from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer).
