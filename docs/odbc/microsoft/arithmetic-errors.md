# Arithmetic Errors
The ODBC driver evaluates the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement as it fetches each row. If a row contains a value that causes an arithmetic error, such as divide-by-zero or numeric overflow, the driver returns all rows, but returns errors for columns with arithmetic errors. When inserting or updating, however, the ODBC driver stops inserting or updating data when the first arithmetic error is encountered.
