# 64-Bit Integer Structures
The C type for the SQL_C_SBIGINT and SQL_C_UBIGINT data type identifiers on Microsoft C compilers is _int64. When a compiler other than a MicrosoftÂ® C compiler is used, the C type might be different. If the compiler supports 64-bit integers natively, the driver or application should define ODBCINT64 to be the native 64-bit integer type. If the compiler does not support 64-bit integers natively, an application or driver can define the following structures to ensure that it has access to this data:  
  
```  
typedef struct{  
SQLUINTEGER dwLowWord;  
SQLUINTEGER dwHighWord;  
} SQLUBIGINT  
  
typedef struct{  
SQLUINTEGER dwLowWord;  
SQLINTEGER sdwHighWord;  
} SQLBIGINT  
```  
  
 These structures should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary because a 64-bit integer is aligned to the 8-byte boundary.
