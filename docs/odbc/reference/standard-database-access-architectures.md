# Standard Database Access Architectures
In looking at the database access components described in the preceding section, it turns out that two of them - programming interfaces and data stream protocols - are good candidates for standardization. The other two components - IPC mechanism and network protocols - not only reside at too low a level but they are both highly dependent on the network and operating system. There is also a third approach - gateways - that provides possibilities for standardization.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Standard Programming Interface](../../odbc/reference/standard-programming-interface.md)  
  
-   [Standard Data Stream Protocol](../../odbc/reference/standard-data-stream-protocol.md)  
  
-   [Standard Gateway](../../odbc/reference/standard-gateway.md)
