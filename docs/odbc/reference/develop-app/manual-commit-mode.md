# Manual-Commit Mode
*In manual-commit mode,* applications must explicitly complete transactions by calling **SQLEndTran** to commit them or roll them back. This is the normal transaction mode for most relational databases.  
  
 Transactions in ODBC do not have to be explicitly initiated. Instead, a transaction begins implicitly whenever the application starts operating on the database. If the data source requires explicit transaction initiation, the driver must provide it whenever the application executes a statement requiring a transaction and there is no current transaction.
