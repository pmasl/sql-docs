# Creating and Terminating Threads
Multithread applications that use ODBC should call the Microsoft速 Visual C++速 Run-Time Library functions **_beginthread** and **_endthread** (or **_beginthreadex** and **_endthreadex**) to create and terminate threads that call the ODBC Driver Manager. If applications call the Microsoft Windows NT速 functions **CreateThread** and **EndThread** instead, memory leaks will occur because the Driver Manager and some ODBC drivers call C run-time functions that will not work on a thread created by calling **CreateThread**. For more information, see the Microsoft Windows速 documentation.
