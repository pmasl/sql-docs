# Choosing a Level of Interoperability
Assuming the application will use ODBC, the next step is to determine what level of interoperability is required. The basic level of interoperability is usually a function of the application type: Custom applications tend not to be interoperable, vertical applications tend to be interoperable among a limited number of DBMSs, and generic applications tend to be interoperable among all DBMSs.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Custom Applications](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/custom-applications.md)  
  
-   [Vertical Applications](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/vertical-applications.md)  
  
-   [Generic Applications](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/generic-applications.md)
