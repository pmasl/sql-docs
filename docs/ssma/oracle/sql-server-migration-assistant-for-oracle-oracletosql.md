# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Oracle (OracleToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Oracle is a tool for migrating Oracle databases to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2014, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2016, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2017 on Windows and Linux, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2019 on Windows and Linux, and Azure SQL Database. SSMA for Oracle converts Oracle database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database objects, creates those objects in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then migrates data from Oracle to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Oracle and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating Oracle databases to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The following table shows articles to help you learn more:
