# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Sybase (SybaseToSQL)

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) is a tool for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2014, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2016, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2017 on Windows and Linux, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2019 on Windows and Linux, or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Azure SQL Database. SSMA for Sybase converts ASE database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database objects, creates those objects in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database, and then migrates data from ASE to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database.
  
This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Sybase and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database and information about issues that might occur after migration.
