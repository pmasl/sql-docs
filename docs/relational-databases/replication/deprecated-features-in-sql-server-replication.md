# Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server SQL MI](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdbmi.md)]
  This topic describes the deprecated Replication features that are still available in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. These features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Deprecated features should not be used in new applications.  
  
## Items Deprecated in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)]  
  
|Feature|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]|Replication is supported if each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] endpoint is within two major versions of the current version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Consequently, [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)].|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)]|Replication is supported if each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] endpoint is within two major versions of the current version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Consequently, [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../includes/ssew-md.md)].|
