# Security Considerations for SQL Server Compact Replication
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  Securing connectivity between an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Database Engine and [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../../includes/ssew-md.md)] involves properly configuring security for both Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
