# Symmetric Keys on System Databases
 [!INCLUDE [SQL Server](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]
  This rule checks for user-created symmetric keys in the master, msdb, model, and tempdb databases.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Do not create symmetric keys in the system databases.
