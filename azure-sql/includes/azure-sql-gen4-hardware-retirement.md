> [!IMPORTANT]
> Gen4 hardware is being retired and is not available for new deployments, as [announced](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/gen-4-hardware-on-azure-sql-database-approaching-end-of-life-in-2020) on December 18, 2019. Customers using Gen4 for Azure SQL Databases, elastic pools, or SQL managed instances should migrate to currently available hardware, such as standard-series (Gen5), before January 31, 2023.
>
> For more information on Gen4 hardware retirement and migration to current hardware, see our [Blog post on Gen4 retirement](https://aka.ms/AAh8l4v). Existing Gen4 databases, elastic pools, and SQL managed instances will be migrated automatically to equivalent standard-series (Gen5) hardware.
>
> Downtime caused by automatic migration will be minimal and similar to downtime during scaling operations within selected service tier. To avoid unplanned interruptions to workloads, migrate proactively at the time of your choice before January 31, 2023.
