# vCore purchasing model - Azure SQL Managed Instance

This article reviews the [vCore purchasing model](../database/service-tiers-vcore.md) for [Azure SQL Managed Instance](sql-managed-instance-paas-overview.md). 

## Overview

[!INCLUDE [vcore-overview](../includes/vcore-overview.md)]

The virtual core (vCore) purchasing model used by Azure SQL Managed Instance provides the following benefits: 

- Control over hardware configuration to better match the compute and memory requirements of the workload.
- Pricing discounts for [Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB)](../azure-hybrid-benefit.md) and [Reserved Instance (RI)](../database/reserved-capacity-overview.md).
- Greater transparency in the hardware details that power compute, helping facilitate planning for migrations from on-premises deployments.
- Higher scaling granularity with multiple compute sizes available.

## <a id="compute-tiers"></a>Service tiers

Service tier options in the vCore purchasing model include General Purpose and Business Critical. The service tier generally defines the storage architecture, space and I/O limits, and business continuity options related to availability and disaster recovery. 

For more details, review [resource limits](resource-limits.md). 

|**Category**|**General Purpose**|**Business Critical**|
|---|---|---|
|**Best for**|Most business workloads. Offers budget-oriented, balanced, and scalable compute and storage options. |Offers business applications the highest resilience to failures by using several isolated replicas, and provides the highest I/O performance.|
|**Read-only replicas**| 0 | 1 | 
|**Replicas for availability**|One replica for high availability| Three high availability replicas, 1 is also a [read-scale replica](../database/read-scale-out.md) |
|**Read-only replicas with [failover groups](auto-failover-group-sql-mi.md) enabled**| One additional read-only replica. Two total readable replicas, which includes the primary replica. | Two additional read-only replicas, three total read-only replicas. Four total readable replicas, which includes the primary replica. |

### Choosing a service tier

For information on selecting a service tier for your particular workload, see the following articles:

- [When to choose the General Purpose service tier](../database/service-tier-general-purpose.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)
- [When to choose the Business Critical service tier](../database/service-tier-business-critical.md#when-to-choose-this-service-tier)

## Compute

SQL Managed Instance compute provides a specific amount of compute resources that are continuously provisioned independent of workload activity, and bills for the amount of compute provisioned at a fixed price per hour.

## Hardware configurations

Hardware configuration options in the vCore model include standard-series (Gen5), premium-series, and memory optimized premium-series. Hardware configuration generally defines the compute and memory limits and other characteristics that impact workload performance.

For more information on the hardware configuration specifics and limitations, see [Hardware configuration characteristics](resource-limits.md#hardware-configuration-characteristics).

In the [sys.dm_user_db_resource_governance](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-user-db-resource-governor-azure-sql-database) dynamic management view, hardware generation for instances using Intel&reg; SP-8160 (Skylake) processors appears as Gen6, while hardware generation for instances using Intel&reg; 8272CL (Cascade Lake) appears as Gen7. The Intel&reg; 8370C (Ice Lake) CPUs used by premium-series and memory optimized premium-series hardware generations appear as Gen8. Resource limits for all standard-series (Gen5) instances are the same regardless of processor type (Broadwell, Skylake, or Cascade Lake).

### Selecting a hardware configuration

You can select hardware configuration at the time of instance creation, or you can change hardware of an existing instance.

**To select hardware configuration when creating a SQL Managed Instance**

For detailed information, see [Create a SQL Managed Instance](../managed-instance/instance-create-quickstart.md).

On the **Basics** tab, select the **Configure database** link in the **Compute + storage** section, and then select desired hardware:

:::image type="content" source="../database/media/service-tiers-vcore/configure-managed-instance.png" alt-text="configure SQL Managed Instance"  loc-scope="azure-portal":::
  
**To change hardware of an existing SQL Managed Instance**

#### [The Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

From the SQL Managed Instance page, select **Pricing tier** link placed under the Settings section

:::image type="content" source="../database/media/service-tiers-vcore/change-managed-instance-hardware.png" alt-text="change SQL Managed Instance hardware"  loc-scope="azure-portal":::

On the Pricing tier page, you will be able to change hardware as described in the previous steps.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Use the following PowerShell script:

```powershell-interactive
Set-AzSqlInstance -Name "managedinstance1" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01" -ComputeGeneration Gen5
```

For more details, check [Set-AzSqlInstance](/powershell/module/az.sql/set-azsqlinstance) command.

#### [The Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Use the following CLI command:

```azurecli-interactive
az sql mi update -g mygroup -n myinstance --family Gen5
```

For more details, check [az sql mi update](/cli/azure/sql/mi#az-sql-mi-update) command.

When specifying hardware parameter in templates or scripts, hardware is provided by using its name. The following table applies:

|Hardware|Name|
|:-- |:-- |
|Standard-series (Gen5)|Gen5|
|Premium-series|G8IM|
|Memory optimized premium-series|G8IH|

### Hardware availability

#### <a id="gen4gen5-1"></a> Gen4

[!INCLUDE[azure-sql-gen4-hardware-retirement](../includes/azure-sql-gen4-hardware-retirement.md)]

#### Standard-series (Gen5) and premium-series

Standard-series (Gen5) and premium-series hardware is available in all public regions worldwide.
  
Memory optimized premium-series hardware is in preview, and has limited regional availability. For more information, see [Azure SQL Managed Instance resource limits](../managed-instance/resource-limits.md#hardware-configuration-characteristics).
